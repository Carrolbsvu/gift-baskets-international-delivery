===================================

I ordered gift basket on site www.gift-baskets-international-delivery.com  after a friend of mine received one of their Get Well baskets. The concept was so unique (everything comes from local artisans) that I decided to use them for mothers day. My Midwestern mom loved it! Not only was it full of all sorts of tasty things, but everything was specific to the bay area, and thus completely new to her. Apparently my gift won her the 'best mom's day present' at her office. Since then I've also sent a birthday basket, which also drew rave reviews from the recipient. Everything is top notch quality and beautifully assembled. Carol
